I am a girl in the twelfth grade at Pursat High School. I live in Krang Poleak Village, Svay Att Province, Pursat. Both of my parents are farmers. I have four siblings, one brother and three sisters. I like to read books, do homework and do housework when I have freetime. I want to attend school at Sustainable Cambodia because I want to get a lot of knowledge from teachers at Sustainable Cambodia. My favorite part of school is the library and my favorite subject is English because it is important to learn for a job. When I grow up I want to be an engineer because I can get much money.
